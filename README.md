# goeval - Evaluate Go snippets instantly from the command line

## Demo

    $ goeval -i fmt 'fmt.Println("Hello, world!")'
    Hello, world!
    $ goeval -i fmt -i os 'fmt.Println(os.Args[1])' 'Hello, world!'
    Hello, world!

    $ goeval -i fmt -i math/big -i os 'var x, y, z big.Int; x.SetString(os.Args[1], 10); y.SetString(os.Args[2], 10); fmt.Println(z.Mul(&x, &y).String())' 45673432245678899065433367889424354 136762347343433356789893322

## Install

    $ go get golang.org/x/tools/goimports
    $ go get -u github.com/dolmen-go/goeval

## How does it work?

`goeval` just wraps your code with the necessary text to build a `main` package and a `main` func with the given imports, pass it through the `goimports` tool (to automatically add missing imports), writes in a temporary file and calls `go run`.
