// Command goeval allows to run Go snippets given on the command line.
//
// A Go toolchain must be available in $PATH as goeval relies on "go run".
//
// The code, given either as the first argument or on stdin, is wrapped as
// the body of a main() function in a main package, and executed with "go run".
//
// Imports are implicit (they are usually resolved automatically thanks to
// [goimports]) but they can be explicitely specified using -i.
// If at least one package import is given with a version (import-path@version),
// a full Go module is assembled, and imports without version are resolved
// as the latest version available in the local Go module cache (GOMODCACHE).
//
// In GOPATH mode (the default), the local Go context is involved only if the current
// directory happens to be in GOPATH and the package is imported.
// In Go module mode, the local Go context (go.mod, .go source files) is completely
// ignored for resolving imports and compiling the snippet.
//
// -play runs the code in the sandbox of [the Go Playground] instead of the local
// machine and replays the output.
//
// -share posts the code for storage on [the Go Playground] and displays the URL.
//
// ðŸš€ Quick Start
//
//	go install github.com/dolmen-go/goeval@latest
//	goeval 'fmt.Println("Hello, world")'
